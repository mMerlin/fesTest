<h1>Frizting Part test modification log</h1>
<h2>Initial Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get base <a href="getworking.html">working part files</a> from the core DIP_Relay_D31A relay part</li>
  <li>Change the fzp moduleId to a new unique value</li>
  <li>generate a new testPart.fzpz from the parts files</li>
  <li>import testPart, place it, generate base (working) view exports files</li>
  <li>commit base working part configuration (3fd9aa5)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing paths</h2>

<h3>test01</h3>
<p>Open schematic svg with atom, and resave, removing trailing spaces. Verify the actual terminal connection points. Looks good</p>

<h3>test02</h3>
<p>Open schematic svg with inkscape, and save as Plain SVG. Inkscape generated file is considerable larger. 12453 versus 8532 bytes</p>
<ul>
  <li>~/development/repos/xmldiffs/xmldiffs.py /usr/share/fritzing/parts/svg/core/schematic/DIP_Relay_D31A_schematic.svg ./svg.schematic.DIP_Relay_D31A_schematic.svg<ul>
      <li>Considerable differences though enough common to maintain synchronization.<ul>
          <li>added defs element</li>
          <li>added metadata element</li>
          <li>added id attributes</li>
          <li>moved (reordered) elements</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Schematic symbol rotated 90 degrees clockwise from base, but not the part label text. The raw schematic svg looks the same (matching base export orientation)</li>
      <li>all of the expected content seems to be there</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>test03</h3>
<p>revert to previous schematic svg file, and start simplifying (using text editor)</p>
<ul>
  <li>move pin label text attributes from text elements to containing group<ul>
      <li>svg view export rotated 90 degrees clockwise from base, same as inkscape version</li>
      <li>test03a_schem.svg content looks good</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>merge pin label text groups. test03b_schem.svg export looks good. Back to same orientation as base.</li>
  <li>remove enable-background attributes: pin label text group and svg element. test03c_schem.svg export looks good. Back to same orientation as base.</li>
  <li>remove all but coil from internal graphics and set internal text to relay. test03d_schem.svg export looks good.</li>
  <li>move pin line attributes from line elements to containing group. merge pin line groups. test03e_schem.svg export looks good. The eh, ev, er tests have all the content, but the text elements are incorrectly rotated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>test04</h3>
<p>Here is what is left in the schematic svg file</p>
<ul>
  <li>Top level group with id schematic containing<ul>
			<li>group with id layer1 containing<ul>
					<li>1 rect element for the schematic body background</li>
					<li>1 group containing 7 text elements for the connection pin labels</li>
					<li>1 group containing a single path for the simplified internal schematic graphics
					<li>1 text element with the interior schematic label</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>16 rect elements with id connector«n» and connector«n» for «n» in (0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>move the connector… rect elements inside of the layer1 group. The interior body of the schematic symbol only highlights on hover in about a 0.15 inch band. No obvious matching graphics. The outer symbol (background and pins) highlights correctly.</p>
<p>The schematic pins can not be selected, to make connections.</p>

<h3>test05</h3>
<p>move the connector… elements back outside of the layer1 group. Move the unnamed group of connector lines outside of the layer1 group (just before the rect elements). The line elements do not show up in a simple viewer, even before combining into a part. Redo, duplicating the transform from the layer1 group. test05_schem.svg content looks good, though back to be rotated 90 degrees again.</p>

<h3>test06</h3>
<p>reduce the transform offset to (0,0) adjusting the line x and y attributes to match. Tweak numbers for consistency, and round to nicer multiples. 7.2 px per 0.1 inch step between pins. Currently each pin line is 8.7 px, or .12 inches long. test06_schem.svg content looks good, though again rotated 90 degrees.</p>

<h3>test07</h3>
<p>move the connector pin line elements outside of their (no attributes) container groups, and delete the now empty groups (still in the group with the common attributes). test07a_schem.svg content looks good, though again rotated 90 degrees.</p>

<h3>test08</h3>
<p>add connector6 id to line element, and remove original connector6 rect element. Connectors work in Fritzing, test08a_schem.svg content looks good, back to base orientation.</p>
<p>add matching connector«n» ids to the rest of the connector pin lines, and remove the rect elements with connector«n» ids. test08b_schem.svg content looks good, though again rotated 90 degrees.</p>
<p>cleanup connector«n»terminal rect element position and size. Set the center of the rectangle to the defined edge of the schematic graphics (it extends outside to main range rectangle). test08c_schem.svg content looks good, though again rotated 90 degrees.</p>
<p>This is now down to a fairly minimal schematic part graphic. It is only 69 lines, 3782 bytes while the Fritzing schematice template file is 88 lines (some blank), 5971 bytes. This is smaller due to moving common attribute values to containing group element. The template also has a few extra example graphic elements.</p>
<p>Recalculate and fix the rest of the connector«n»terminal rect element position and size values. test08d_schem.svg content looks good, though again rotated 90 degrees.</p>

<h3>test09</h3>
<p>Bring some of the updates from the schematic template file into the working svg.</p>
<p>Set the svg element attributes: version, baseProfile, and id to match the template file: 1.2, tiny, Layer_1. Add full size (as viewBox) background rectangle outside of schematic group. This DOES get carried into Fritzing view, but not exported to svg image. Useful for viewing raw svg schematic file, without the hatched transparent background. Add duplicate rectangle at the top of the schematic group, commented out, to allow easy addition of background when viewing exported svg. test09a_schem.svg content looks good, rotated 90 degrees from base.</p>
<p>Remove svg element xmlns:… attributes that are not in the template. Add 0.1 inch help reference block that will be included in Fritzing, but not exported to the view svg. Add xmlns:xml namespace attribute to schematic group. Remove layer1 id from group. test09b_schem.svg content looks good, rotated 90 degrees from base.</p>

<pre>
see about removing that large offset transform
oddity: the template has pin connection lines, but no connector… ids
</pre>

<h3>test-future</h3>
<p>There is still some cleanup needed for the used schematic graphics, to get things to land properly on the 0.1 inch grid. It is near time to try modifying the breadboard svg file, so see if there is an interaction between them. By itself, the schematic svg file is small, simple structure, and working.</p>
<pre>
relay, even SPST, could use the split schematic: the coil and each switch could be separated on the schematic.
